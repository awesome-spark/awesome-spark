## Adding an item to the list

- Please check for previous suggestions before creating a new PR.
- Submit only one link at the time.
- If a project provides a GitHub repository add the link: `* [project-name](http://example.com/) <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/owner-name/project-name.svg"> - A short description ends with a period.`
- If you add a new section, please add it also the section title to the Table of Contents.
- New Links should be appended at the end of the relevant section.
- Make sure that the new entry doesn't contain trailing whitespace.
- Don't mention `Spark` in the description as it is implied.
