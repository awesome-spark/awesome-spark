## Adding an item to the list

- Please check for previous suggestions and [removed projects](https://github.com/awesome-spark/awesome-spark/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Adeprecation) before creating a new PR. 
- Submit only one link at the time.
- If a project provides a GitHub repository add the link: `* [project-name](http://example.com/) <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/owner-name/project-name.svg"> - A short description ends with a period.`
- If you add a new section, please add it also the section title to the Table of Contents.
- New Links should be appended at the end of the relevant section.
- Make sure that the new entry doesn't contain trailing whitespace.
- Don't mention `Spark` in the description as it is implied.

## Adding non-free content

Please note that we normally don't merge proposals that haven't been tested and approved by at least one team member. If you are an author, publisher or operator of a resource which is not freely available please consider providing us with a review copy of the resource (or equivalent depending on the type of the proposal).
